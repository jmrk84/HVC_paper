1. Contents
-------------------
This repository contains the data files (see releases for a data.zip with tracings annotations) as well as source code required for
the analysis. In case of questions or difficulties running the code, please contact
joergen.kornfeld@bi.mpg.de

2. Provided data
-------------------
2.1 Registered raw EM dataset

A streaming configuration file (j0256.conf) is provided for KNOSSOS (www.knossostool.org) that can be used
to easily access all image data and perform your own tracings in the dataset. Additionally raw data hostings (e.g. on neurodata.io) will also be listed here as soon as they are available.

The configuration file can also be used together with the knossosDataset class provided
in the public knossos_utils package to directly work with the dataset (e.g. download it, convert
to an image stack, etc).

2.2 Skeleton files

All annotations are provided in a zip file, that contains the necessary data to run the functions of HVC_RA_analysis.py.
The .k.zip files can also be opened directly in KNOSSOS for further analysis. Note that all postsynaptic tracings are contained within
the axon k.zips.
